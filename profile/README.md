# Helios Profiles
Helios Profiles holds several aircraft profiles for the [Helios Virtual Cockpit](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases/latest) system.

To have an entry on this page, the profile needs to be
1. The submittor's own work **or** have the agreement of the original author if the profile is a derivative work
1. Contain no program executables
1. Contain no material which might cause offence.
1. Contain no links to external sites
1. Contain no advertising (other than to acknowledge profile contributors)
1. Have a distribution download link which will not change as the profile is updated
1. Have a download distribution link that is free to use.
1. Ideally profiles should be packaged as a [helios16 package](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/wiki/Helios-Archive)
